# Greeves Motocross Glory Days

Greeves Motocross Glory Days is a site designed to keep motocross history alive and to inform people on the success and development of the Greeves Motorcycle company. The site will be targeted toward Greeves,motocross and classic motorcycle fans. Love Running will be useful for fans of classic motorcycles and motocross as the images on the site will be a place of reference to anyone restoring a Greeves motorcycle and will give a brief insight on how the motorcycles were developed.

## Features 

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so. You will need to explain what value each of the features provides for the user, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

### Existing Features

- __Navigation Buttons__

 -Appears on all pages of the site in the same format on each page so it is easy for the user. Contrasting colours have been used between the text, background and border of the links so they are esy to read and stand out from the page background image. 


- __Fullscreen background image__

  -A full screen background image has been used for this site as it will appeal to the target audience. The image has a large resolution so it will not appear pixelated.

- __Centered images and text throughout__

  - I have used centered text and images throughout to keep the format consistant and professional. The content is easy to read and follow for the user.

- __Video with user controls__

  - This section will allow the user to see exactly when the meetups will happen, where they will be located and how long the run will be in kilometers. 
  - This section will be updated as these times change to keep the user up to date.

- __Images and Videos__
  -Images and Videos on this website are being hosted by an image hosting website. This means they do not take up space in the directory. 

### Features Left to Implement

In the future I would like to add another page to the site with a gallery of all images used

## Testing 

The target audience of my website is likely to be middle aged or older and so I wanted to test that all features worked and were easy to understand and use. To do this I have tested my website on different browsers (Chrome, Edge and Firefox) and on multiple devices (Computer, laptop and mobile)

I did find a bug that the background didnt always display fully on different screen sizes. The image is still high quality and looks well.

## Deployment

Deployment was difficult initially with GitHub and Gitpod. GitPod would not allow me to commit or push on my project due to a permission error. This meant that I had to use an external text editor program. I then uploaded the files from my external program to GitHub for deployment. This created issues for my commit history as I could not create and transfer commits to GitHub. This has left my commit history very bare, with only a few large commits for file uploads and edits to some html src links. I have since rectified the permission issue and have been adding commits to my project. I have also commented on the existing commits trying to clarify what was being commited.

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. I had some extra work to do in order to get my project deployed on GitHub pages as my GitPod and GitHub refused to link together meaning I had to manually upload new files to my Github repository. Once this was done the deployment was quite straight forward. The steps to deploy are as follows: 

-On GitHub, navigate to your site's repository.

-Under your repository name, click  Settings.
Repository settings button

-Under the "Code and automation" section of the sidebar, click  Pages.

-Under "Build and deployment"  select "Source", select Deploy from a branch.

-Under "Build and deployment", under "Branch", select main, then save.
