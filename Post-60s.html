                <h1> Success at Home and in Europe </h1> <br> 
            <p> With a new factory rider and a further developed Hawkstone 250cc, Greeves would begin to see serious success in European and British motocross. Dave Bickers would win the 1960 and 1961 European 250 Motocross Championship on the Hawkstone aswell as the British Championship every year from 1960 - 1965, cementing the Greeves name in motocross history.</p>

                <p> Greeves was now a well known manufacturer of winning machines and therefore, development continued, and in 1962 the Hawkstone was offered with Greeves' own engine developed and manufactured in the Greeves factory.</p>

                <br>
                <p>Greeves, now with a greater reputation and winning bikes, hired a plethora of riders such as Bryan Wade, Alan Clough, Vic Allen and Bryan Goss, who began to dominate the 250cc and unlimited classes, especially in Britain. The little Invacar company had become a goliath in the emerging sport of motocross.</p>

                <p>Some further developments saw the production of the Greeves Challenger in 1964, which quickly became known as the best lightweight 2 stroke motocross bike of the time. Five years and many trophies later, the Greeves Griffon would also be released.</p>
