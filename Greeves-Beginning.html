            <h1> The Birth of Greeves Motorcycles</h1> <br>
                <p>The Greeves Motorcycle Company began in 1952 in post-war Britain. The company's original name was Invacar and initially produced motorised 3-wheel vehicles for wheelchair-bound individuals from the small factory in Thundersley, Essex. The owner, Bert Greeves, was personally motivated by his desire to help his disabled cousin, Derry Preston Cobb, and came up with the idea of Invacar one day when he decided to combine his cousin's wheelchair with a lawnmower engine. Derry's personal Invacar would be used as a promotional vehicle and would be fitted with a bigger 250cc engine producing speeds up to 80mph. Stories are told of Derry overtaking cars on public roads, shocking drivers and pedestrians alike. The need for invacars in post-war Britain saw the Greeves company awarded a contract from the Ministry of Pensions. Bert, who was a keen motorcyclist, saw this as an opportunity to expand and diversify his company into motorcycle manufacturing and thus, the Greeves motorcycle name was born.</p>

                <p> Bert and Derry's shared love of speed and motorcycles saw Bert hiring Derry and their combined engineering skills lead to the first production motorcycles in 1954. Starting with four different production models, two road bikes, one trials bike and one scrambler design. Initial sales were slow but steady, helped by the unique design of a cast aluminium frame down-section and Greeves' patented leading link front suspension which had never been seen before. Bert also put his faith in 2 stroke engines, half the size, weight and complexity of other 4 stroke engines at the time, which could have been seen as a gamble as their potential was not yet recognised as high performance engines. These unique designs lead to lower weight, high stability motorcycles that began to see success in trials events, competing with big names such as BSA.</p>

                <p>In 1957, Bert hired a young English scrambles rider named Brian Stonebridge who would join the company as competition manager and development engineer. Stonebridge would be the first major success for Greeves and, in 1959 would take 2nd place in the 250cc European Motocross Championship, just 5 years after the first Greeves production motorcycle left the factory. This helped to boost Greeves' sales at home and abroad in Europe. With Stonebridge's help, Greeves also managed to sign Dave Bickers, another young Englishman, as a Greeves factory rider. Just in time for the release of the Greeves Hawkstone MDS 250. This pairing would be the beginning of the Greeves motocross success story.</p>
