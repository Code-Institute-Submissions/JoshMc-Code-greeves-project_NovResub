            <p>After 5 years of development on the challenger model, Bert Greeves knew he must design a new motocrosser that could keep up with the rapidly advancing bikes being produced in Britain, Europe and from new players Japan. This is where the Griffon comes in. A new design with a larger wheel base, even lighter total weight and a new Greeves 250cc engine. The new model would also come with telescopic suspension, moving on from the signature leading link and a completely tubular frame, leaving the cast aluminium downframe behind. </p>

         <p>Improving on the now ageing Challenger model specs, the Griffon was a serious performance machine. When introduced, the Griffon was a serious threat to competitors and would go on to win British championships. Griffons would also gain popularity in the United States and riders such as Bryan Wade would see racing action in California on his Griffon 250cc. There would also be a 380cc twinport model released in 1969. Many riders would choose the 250cc though, as the 380cc twinport didn't offer enough of a power increase to justify the heavier bike.</p>

        <p>The Greeves Factory would recognise the lackluster performance of its 380cc Twinport model and would seek help from a young Engineering professor at Queen's University Belfast to help with the fluid dynamics of the exhaust system on the 380cc model. Professor Gordon Blair, a genius of engineering, developed a new exhaust system that would add an impressive 6.5bhp and really give the 380cc the power it needed. This new 380cc model would use a single exhaust instead of the Twinports 2 exhausts. It would be called the Griffon 380 QUB, after the university.</p>
