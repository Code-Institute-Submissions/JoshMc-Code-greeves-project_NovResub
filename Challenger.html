            <p>The Greeves Challenger did almost everything right during its time as a production model. A lightweight 2-stroke 250cc engined scrambler perfectly suited to the rough terrain and torturous stresses that would be thrown at it. 2-Stroke technology still wasnt taken seriously in 1964, with most competitors still opting for large 4-stroke engines. 10 years later, in the 70s, 2-stroke technology would go on to dominate the sport until the modern day. This shows just how "ahead of the times" Greeves were. </p>

         <br>
                   
         <p> The challenger boasted some great specs for its time, i.e: 28bhp, 0-60mph in 10s, 100kg in weight and a top speed of 84mph. Not to mention the signature Greeves leading link front suspension or "banana forks" as they were known, offer 2 1/2 inches of extra travel over their counterparts. They also kept the wheelbase constant due to their geometry. This consistency helped with the handling.</p>
                   
         <br>          
            
        <p> The success achieved by the 250cc Challenger spurred-on the development of a larger 360cc model to compete in the 500cc class in European and British motocross. The 250cc, which was already winning some 500cc and unlimated class races, was ultimately struggling against the bigger, more powerful 500cc competition. The 360cc was to be the answer and improved on the already impressive specs of the 250cc. In particular, the 360 had a great 0-60mph time of 8s. 2s Quicker than the 250cc! </p>
